### **Introduction to TACE for HCC**

- **What is TACE?**
  - A treatment for advanced liver tumors, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  - Used for tumors that cannot be removed with surgery.
  - HCC: Most frequent liver cancer, representing about 90% of primary liver cancers.
  - Third leading cause of cancer death worldwide in 2020.

**Description:**

- **Effectiveness of TACE:**

  - Based on selective blood flow manipulation.
  - Liver blood supply: Hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery.
  - Tumor blood supply: Mainly from the hepatic artery.
  - Catheter navigated to tumor site to block hepatic artery and inject chemotherapy.

- **Procedure:**
  - Catheter threaded through an artery in the groin.
  - Chemotherapeutic agents injected at tumor site.
  - Ensures concentrated chemotherapy and minimizes systemic exposure.
  - Embolization restricts tumor's access to nutrients and oxygen.

**Ideal Candidates for TACE:**

- Preserved liver function.
- Multinodular tumors or isolated large tumors (>3 cm).

**Conclusion:**

- TACE: Minimally invasive, effective approach for targeting liver cancer.
- Enhances therapeutic effect while minimizing damage to healthy tissue.
